/*
	Program Description: This program serves as interpreter for a SNOL (Simple Number Only Language).
	It consists of three parts: Source, Utilities, and Storage
	Source: Serves as the main part of the program where the I/O part is done
	Utilities (Util.cpp) : Consists of utility functions where important parts involving syntax and grammar checking is done
	Storage (Storage.cpp) : Class file that deals with variable storage and manipulation

	Additional information:
		Command types:
			0 = Command unrecognized or invalid syntax
			1 = BEG command, for storing a value to a variable
			2 = PRINT command, for displaying the value of a variable
			3 = EXIT! command, for exiting the program
			4 = Calculation is done without storage, but syntax checking is important
			5 = Assignment is done to a variable
